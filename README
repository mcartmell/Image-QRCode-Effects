Image-QRCode-Effects

This module provides a collection of effects commonly used on QRCodes to make
them look interesting.

It's designed for use with the Imager::QRCode manpage, although it'll likely
work with any barcode images. Providing you don't stray too far from the
default parameters, the resulting barcode should be easily readable.
